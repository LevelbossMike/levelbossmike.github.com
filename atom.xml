    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone that has tried to achieve something with programming a computer
knows the feeling when you want to do something with or you have deal with a technology that is new to you. Most of the time you have to get your head around a new way of thinking, a new tool, an unfamiliar API, code that someone else has written or a new programming syntax and at first most likely your feelings come close to the feeling the kitten on the left expresses in the picture below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/2758/firstiwaslike.jpg&quot; title=&quot;First I was like?!&quot; alt=&quot;First I was like?! Then I loled!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after some time occupying yourself with the new unknown most of the
time you get it. And you&amp;#8217;re like „Oh Yeah! LOL!“. Like the kitten on the
right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is about my „Oh Yeah! LOL!“-Moments. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
